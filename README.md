# stablesflowerco

This project started in August 2023 when a local florist requested that I update their previous Wix website with a new updated Shopify Store. 

A selection of requirements for the new store were communicated;
  - There needed to be a date selector for local deliveries. (Due to the nature of the goods being delivered, timing is of the essence and so specific dates for delivery were a must!)
  - A cross-sell pop-up was requested once a user reached the checkout. This would allow for complimentary product promotion depending on what was currently in the user's basket.
    (The idea was that for Valentines, a complimentary teddy bear would be promoted)
  - A further pop-up for a 'first-time buyers discount' was requested and this presents itself once the user enters the online store of the website. (There are email checks in place to ensure only first time buyers can avail of this)
  - The online store needed to be capable of selling tickets to flower school classes 

The design for the website was to be monochrome in black and white with all of the colour coming from the flowers themselves. 

The project was completed within 2 weeks with all of the above features fully implemented and there were 2 revisions to the design to have it all looking and working perfectly.

Overall this was a fantastic project to work on and one I am very proud of. The client now has an easy to use inventory system for the online store and the perfect foundation for adding more products and services to.
